# Assembly-Grade-Calculator
The purpose of this project was to determine if students passed a class. This was coded in a distribution of assembly language using Index Register X and Y and Accumulator A and B. It was loaded onto a Wytec Dragon12 Plus board and would display a P or F on parallel ports.
